It analyzes the experience of three housing developments converted under the Public Housing Homeownership Demonstration of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Obstacles to conversion included the extensive renovations needed before transfer, the prohibition against involuntary relocation of tenants, the work of generating interest in the cooperatives, and the difficulty of financing. Indicators of the cooperatives\u2019 success are mixed. One faces serious financial problems; the other two are financially sound despite substantial amounts of share payments in arrears. One set of cooperators is largely dissatisfied with living in the cooperative; the other two sets are mildly satisfied. Factors inhibiting greater success included inadequate board training, poor communication between board and residents, lack of participation by cooperators, and the need for major repairs soon after purchase.","URL":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/10511482.1995.9521192","DOI":"10.1080\/10511482.1995.9521192","shortTitle":"Converting public housing to cooperatives","author":[{"family":"Rohe","given":"William M."}],"issued":{"raw":"1995"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-11-14"}}]}

The forms, aims, advocates and development of tenant participation have varied, so that events are not well explained by functionalist theories of the state. While there have been significant economic influences, political and cultural factors (particularly the ideology of consumer expectations) have been very important in putting tenant participation on the agenda of both the tenants\u2019 movement and the state.","URL":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/02673039008720689","DOI":"10.1080\/02673039008720689","author":[{"family":"Hague","given":"Cliff"}],"issued":{"raw":"1990"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-11-14"}}]}

Public consultation in housing formed part of the democratic planning process, as extensive post\u2010war housing provision became a necessity. This article explores the nature of popular opinion on housing and how it may have intersected with the ideas of architects and planners. The results of several opinion surveys suggested that the public held varied, even contradictory, views on the question of housing. Nevertheless, there was a strong demand on its part for better housing affording greater privacy. This was clearly acknowledged by some experts, who tried to take note of these views to produce plans for post\u2010war housing in tune with the public's needs and tastes.","URL":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/13619460008581573","DOI":"10.1080\/13619460008581573","shortTitle":"Planners and the public","author":[{"family":"Tsubaki","given":"Tatsuya"}],"issued":{"raw":"2000"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-11-14"}}]}

Although Conservative policy makers were generally sensitive to the charge that the party in power would dismantle the welfare state, and were therefore cautious in promoting alternatives to Labour, the approach to housing was quite different. Labour housing policy under Bevan was much less successful than other aspects of government policy, and the Conservative record during the housing boom of the 1930s had been a strong one. Public opinion surveys consistently identified housing as the single greatest source of social policy concern throughout this period. Housing therefore offered the party a chance to promote a distinctly Conservative policy during the election campaign of 1951, which stressed property ownership and free enterprise. The fulfilling of the 300,000 pledge in 1953 cemented the public perception of Conservative policy success in \u2018freeing\u2019 the housing market, in spite of the fact that most of those new houses continued to be built by local authorities. This popular image provided the basis upon which the party could take bolder measures to remodel the structure of housing provision after 1955.","URL":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/13619460008581574","DOI":"10.1080\/13619460008581574","shortTitle":"\u2018This is magnificent!\u2019","author":[{"family":"Jones","given":"Harriet"}],"issued":{"raw":"2000"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-11-14"}}]}

If recent struggles over the meaning of urban space testify to the interarticulation of neo-liberal norms with an increasingly revanchist approach to local governance, the main aim of the paper is to acknowledge various attempts to contest these developments. More specifically, it seeks to highlight the role and significance of the German Hausbesetzerbewegung (squatter movement) from the 1960s onwards. Despite a growing body of literature on the role of '1968' as a watershed moment in the evolution of new social movements in West Germany, there remains little empirical work on the role of squatter movements within a broader matrix of protest and resistance. To what extent was the squatter movement in West Germany successful in articulating a creative reworking of the built form and urban space more generally? In what way were these counterclaims to the city performed? And how were these alternative cartographies organised at the level of the everyday? The paper proposes to answer these framing questions with particular reference to Berlin's squatting scene and longstanding struggles since the late 1960s over architectural space, ecological practice and 'insurgent' forms of citizenship.

Most critics argued that the programs had produced a technology unsuited to the needs of small peasant farmers. This paper explores why such inappropriate technology might have been developed, focusing on the early years of the Rockefeller Foundation's Mexican Agricultural Program (MAP). It shows that some foundation officers as well as agricultural advisors had prior experience of the problems faced by small farmers in the United States and elsewhere. Moreover, the foundation's expressed concern for rural poverty does not appear to have been mere posturing by an organization anxious to be seen as an agent of philanthropy. Furthermore, the program's early work in maize-breeding was well tailored to the conditions of Mexican agriculture. Once the MAP was up and running, however, it became apparent that the task of getting new varieties and cultivation practices to small farmers was going to be difficult. Needing to make some kind of impact quickly, MAP staff chose to concentrate upon projects that were likely to find a rapid uptake. This meant setting aside the needs of peasant farmers to develop high-yielding varieties suited to large commercial farms.

Its purpose is to disentangle some of the issues which arise in the sociology of development, and to question the assumptions and implications of a particular mode of conceptualization based on the notions of modernity and modernization which has provided the characteristic theoretical framework of the sociology of development. The principal assumptions of modernization theory as understood here\u2014often enough made explicit by those who use this approach\u2014are (1) that modernization is a total social process associated with (or subsuming) economic development in terms of the preconditions, concomitants, and consequences of the latter; (2) that this process constitutes a \u2018universal pattern\u2019. Obviously among various writers there are differences of emphasis with respect to the meaning of modernization, partly due to its relationship with\u2014or derivation from\u2014that most contentious concept \u2018development\u2019. For Lerner modernization is \u2018the social process of which development is the economic component\u2019 (Lerner, 1967, p. 21); while Apter sees development, modernization and industrialization as terms of decreasing conceptual generality (Apter, 1967, pp. 67\u20139). Some writers stress structural aspects while for others \u2018the concept of modernization has to do with a transformation of culture and of personality in so far as it is influenced by culture, rather than of some aspect of social organization or of human ecology\u2019 (Stephen\u2010son, 1968, p. 265). It is hoped that the following discussion is both specific enough to convey the essential aspects of the type of theory under review, and flexible enough to allow for some of the variants on the basic theme in what is a highly condensed survey of a substantial body of literature.1 The critical approach adopted reflects certain ideas about societies and hence the questions social scientists should ask; these preoccupations cannot be discussed fully within present limits but are indicated in the suggestions contained in the concluding section. The first section serves to outline the context in which the concept of development studies arose. This is followed by a schematic outline of the central concepts and conceptual procedures of the sociology of development, and more specifically of modernization theory, which are then criticized on a number of counts. These criticisms lead on to an argument for the use of a historical perspective\u2014moreover, one which results in a re\u2010examination of the concept of underdevelopment, relating it to the expansion of Western capitalism and the effects of this process on the diverse indigenous societies of what is now called the Third World. The relationships of dependence and exploitation created by the process are exemplified in the colonial situation as narrowly defined though this is by no means the only situation characterized by such relationships. This perspective, developed in the work of certain political economists, can serve as the basis of a sociological approach which would prove more fruitful both in understanding the nature of underdevelopment itself, and in assessing the range of possibilities of development in the Third World, than that generally employed in the sociology of development at present.","URL":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/00220387108421356","DOI":"10.1080\/00220387108421356","author":[{"family":"Bernstein","given":"Henry"}],"issued":{"raw":"1971"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-10-01"}}]}

In Mandarins of the Future: Modernization Theory in Cold War America Nils Gilman offers the first intellectual history of a movement that has had far-reaching and often unintended consequences.After a survey of the theory's origins and its role in forming America's postwar sense of global mission, Gilman offers a close analysis of the people who did the most to promote it in the United States and the academic institutions they came to dominate. He first explains how Talcott Parsons at Harvard constructed a social theory that challenged the prevailing economics-centered understanding of the modernization process, then describes the work of Edward Shils and Gabriel Almond in helping Parsonsian ideas triumph over other alternative conceptions of the development process, and finally discusses the role of Walt Rostow and his colleagues at M.I.T. in promoting modernization theory during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. By connecting modernization theory to the welfare state liberalism programs of the New Deal order, Gilman not only provides a new intellectual context for America's Third World during the Cold War, but also connects the optimism of the Great Society to the notion that American power and good intentions could stop the postcolonial world from embracing communism.","ISBN":"9780801886331","shortTitle":"Mandarins of the Future","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Gilman","given":"Nils"}],"issued":{"raw":"2007-02-15"}}]}

Experience with irrigation projects in developing countries is consistent with this \u201csensitivity hypothesis,\u201d but the hypothesis is probably applicable to the management of other goods and services such as social welfare, education, public health, and transportation.","URL":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu\/doi\/10.2307\/3324007\/abstract","DOI":"10.2307\/3324007","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Montgomery","given":"John D."}],"issued":{"raw":"1983"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-09-13"}}]}

In one sense it is something as vague as working together, or even, in modern usage, ready to help. In the other it is the precise, in many countries the legal, definition of a particular kind of business organization. But the business organizations which claim this title in the world today are of a bewildering variety the largest firm of wholesale grocers and flour millers in the British Isles, a little group of African village women col lecting palm kernels in the wilds of Nigeria, a crew of Icelandic fishermen putting to sea in their trawler, careful French farmers insuring their cattle against loss by accident or disease, civil servants in war-devastated cities rebuilding their bombed homes, Canadian farmers getting half the wheat of the prairies to market, Serbian peasants taking their sick to hospital, Malayan clerks running a bank, Russian tailoresses making army uniforms, Czech farmers wiring their houses and barns for electric light. What is there that is common to all these enterprises Fundamentally, no doubt, the ideas of helpfulness and working together which belong to the non-technical use of the word. There is, however, something more precise which distinguishes co-operative from other business activities, some thing which belongs partly to ends and partly to means. Writing in 1908, Dr. C. R. Fay 1 defined a co-operative society as an association for the purposes of joint trading, originating among the weak and conducted always in an un selfish spirit on such terms that all who are prepared to assume the duties of membership share in its rewards in proportion to the degree in which they make use of their association. It is a good definition, though trading is too narrow a term to cover 1 Co-operation at Home and Abroad, by C. R. Fay, 1908. 7 8 THE WORLD CO-OPERATIVE MOVEMENT all the activities which can be carried on co-operatively, and the weak has to be accepted comparatively, acknowledging that even those who, in Ireland, are called strong farmers, arc feeble indeed compared with Imperial Chemicals or the Stan dard Oil Company. A later writer, 1 seeking the common element in all cooperative enterprises, has said that they are associations of persons, small producers or consumers, who have come together voluntarily to achieve some common purpose by a reciprocal exchange of services through a collective economic enterprise working at their common risk and with resources to which all contribute. In this, as in the earlier definition, there are a number of ideas, the ideas offreedom, of democracy, of mutual responsibility in economic life, the idea of an ethical approach to that life. Our age is one in which ideas concerning the right, as well as the expedient, conduct of economic life are held with religious intensity, an age, also, in which these ideas, together with the impact of great technical changes, are bringing about very rapid and widespread changes in the economic structure itself...","ISBN":"9781406777130","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Digby","given":"Margaret"}],"issued":{"raw":"2007-03-30"}}]}

As middle- and upper-income families migrated from the city to the suburban ring, they often left behind a decaying core increasingly populated by low-income and minority families. Despite evidence that these trends are continuing, numerous instances of spontaneous neighborhood revitalization have been occurring recently. While this new dynamic suggests that central cities may be staging a resurgence, it has also created concern that low-income city residents are being displaced from their neighborhoods as they find themselves unable to compete in the inflated housing market. The displacement phenomenon has received widespread attention in the popular press and has become a concern of many neighborhood groups and local planners. This paper reviews the evidence of displacement in revitalizing neighborhoods to determine if available data support the conventional wisdom. The conclusion is that, while displacement may be a serious problem in some neighborhoods, there is little support for the notion that a substantial trend is occurring or that in the aggregate large numbers of poor households are being affected.","URL":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/01944367908976994","DOI":"10.1080\/01944367908976994","author":[{"family":"Sumka","given":"Howard J."}],"issued":{"raw":"1979"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-08-07"}}]}

Improved financial assistance has gone a long way toward ameliorating the adverse economic impacts associated with relocation. The adverse social and psychological impacts of relocation, however, have been more difficult to mitigate. This article presents a case study of a socially sensitive relocation effort that demonstrates the feasibility of relocating an entire community and of thereby preserving important primary social relationships and social support networks. The article also explores the factors that contributed to the success of a citizens' initiative to save their community. The community's success in negotiating the settlement is attributed to its cohesiveness and its ability to develop ties with interest groups outside the community.","URL":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/01944369108975472","DOI":"10.1080\/01944369108975472","shortTitle":"The Politics of Relocation","author":[{"family":"Rohe","given":"William M."},{"family":"Mouw","given":"Scott"}],"issued":{"raw":"1991"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-08-07"}}]}

Its principal purpose was to finance the construction of the Interstate highway system, and its creators' original intention was to terminate the fund when that effort was accomplished. However, the fund has since morphed into an ongoing method of financing a broad range of federal transportation programs and now comprises both a highway account and a mass transit account. Over the years, the structure of the taxes supporting the fund and the rules governing its expenditures and administration have changed, sometimes significantly. Among the most significant changes were a series of increases to tax levels and transfers to the fund (major increases occurred in 1959, 1961, 1966, 1982, and 1997), the imposition of obligation limits in 1974, and the restoration of the user fee concept in 1998. The congressional authorizing acts that provided for these and other revisions to the fund's funding levels and administrative procedures from 1956 to 2003 are documented. The fund's history is a particularly topical subject because Congress continues to address extensions to the fund, the fund's supporting revenues, and the transportation programs it finances.","URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3141\/1885-02","DOI":"10.3141\/1885-02","author":[{"family":"McDaniel","given":"Wayne"},{"family":"Coley","given":"Meredith"}],"issued":{"raw":"January 1, 2004"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-08-07"}}]}

This paper, based on a household survey in Shanghai, examines the process and outcomes of residential relocation under market-oriented urban redevelopment in China. The results show that commodification of the socialist tenancy right helped to initiate large-scale urban redevelopment. First, there has been a complicated process of negotiation during residential relocation, involving residents, development companies, and government agencies. The de facto right of public housing tenants is considered by a pragmatic attitude in urban redevelopment in the early years. Second, residential relocation is accompanied by the changes in housing tenure, housing conditions, and the improved built form of planned residential districts. Nevertheless, the social conflict has become intensified recently because the deepening of commodification began to favour property developers by constraining the compensation standard for relocated households.","URL":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0016718503000897","DOI":"10.1016\/j.geoforum.2003.10.001","shortTitle":"Residential relocation under market-oriented redevelopment","author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Fulong"}],"issued":{"raw":"July 2004"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-08-07"}}]}

Since 1998, they were implemented incrementally together with complementary instruments such as agricultural market liberalization and new economic incentives. Major steps included disentangling socialist producer cooperatives and assigning land-use rights to its former members, developing and adapting a national legal framework (Land Law), and enhancing tenure security through gender-balanced inheritable land-use certificates. In addition to promoting individualized rights, successive reforms have contributed to accelerating the agricultural transformation process by encouraging perennial crop and agroforestry systems (and thus long-term leasehold), and allowing rural land rental and land sales markets to re-emerge. During the 1990s, combined reform efforts sped up agricultural growth and industrialization, thereby enhancing food security, and combating hunger and rural poverty. Individualized rights, liberalized product and input markets, and a new entrepreneurial spirit resulted in intensified irrigated rice production, agricultural diversification, and better food quality. Although reform achievements--accompanied by policy interventions such as export quotas--are tremendous in terms of improved nutritional status and rural livelihoods, more efficient farming and agrarian structures, more secure land investment, access to collateralized credit, and poverty reduction, some challenges to consolidate reforms exist. These challenges include addressing increased urban-rural and regional income disparities, landlessness resulting from emergency land sales, misuse of local elites' power in land allocation, and endangered \"commons\" through land privatization.","URL":"http:\/\/www.ifpri.org\/publication\/land-tenure-policy-reforms","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Kirk","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Tuan","given":"Nguyen Do Anh"}],"issued":{"raw":"2009"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-07-19"}}]}

To date, morphological studies have mapped the medieval city either by classifying urban layouts according to particular types, or by analysing plan forms of particular towns and cities to reveal their spatial evolution. This paper outlines a third way, an &lsquo;iconographic&rsquo; approach, which shows how urban forms in the Middle Ages conveyed Christian symbolism. Three such &lsquo;mappings&rsquo; explore this thesis: the first uses textual and visual representations which show that the city was understood as a scaled-down world - a microcosm - linking city and cosmos in the medieval mind; the second &lsquo;mapping&rsquo; develops this theme further and suggests that urban landscapes were inscribed with symbolic form through their layout on the ground; while the third looks at how Christian symbolism of urban forms was performed through the urban landscape in perennial religious processions. Each of these &lsquo;mappings&rsquo; points to the symbolic, mystical significance urban form had in the Middle Ages, based on religious faith, and they thus offer a deepened appreciation of how urban landscapes were represented, constructed and experienced at the time.","shortTitle":"Cities of God?","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Lilley","given":"Keith D"}],"issued":{"raw":"2004"}}]}

As an example, the region is home to Brazilthe worlds fifth-largest country in terms of both area and populationyet it also comprises numerous Caribbean island nations populated by fewer than 100,000 people. Nonetheless, LAC countries exhibit much commonality, including significant urban populations, high ethnic diversity, and increasing inequality and poverty. Another shared factor is that many LAC countries have reformed or are in the process of reforming their economies through structural adjustment programs. Agriculture faces many challenges in LAC, especially in the context of development. Rising food prices are a growing policy concern for both low- and middle-income countries, and, whereas the region as a whole is a net food exporter, poor consumers suffer the negative impacts of food-price inflation on their incomes and thus on their health and nutrition. In addition, international value chains and supermarkets are transforming domestic food markets, thereby posing serious challenges to smallholders in their ability to remain competitive. As commercial agriculture expands, the agricultural labor market and rural nonfarm economy become vital if resulting productivity gains are to have a beneficial effect on rural poverty.","URL":"http:\/\/cdm15738.contentdm.oclc.org\/u?\/p15738coll2,27261","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Stads","given":"Gert-Jan"},{"family":"Beintema","given":"Nienke"}],"issued":{"raw":"2009"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-07-15"}}]}

As the temperance cause gained momentum during the 1820s many farmers abandoned their cider trees and transitioned to the cultivation of grafted winter apples in New England. In turn agricultural writers used the social and moral rhetoric of antebellum reformers to compel individuals to become better apple growers, citizens, and farmers. Transitions in apple cultivation similarly created new negotiations between farmers, labor, and the land. This study offers new insight into the social and ecological boundaries of agricultural specialization and the often tempestuous interactions between progressive agriculturists and yeomen farmers as they tentatively embraced the elusive promise of scientific agriculture and market capitalism by abandoning the cider press for the cultivation of grafted winter apples like the Rhode Island Greening, Baldwin, and Roxbury Russet between 1820 and 1860.\"--abstract.","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Henris","given":"John Robert"},{"family":"OhioLINK Electronic Theses and Dissertations Center","given":""}],"issued":{"raw":"2009"}}]}

Many such solutions are proposed with little reference to existing local needs and resources. Complex wood harvesting technologies require a long time to diffuse through a population. Therefore, increases in productivity can be better achieved through focusing on the improved maintenance and deployment of proper hand tools. Evidence from Kenya is used to demonstrate the improvements that can be made in hand-tool production and maintenance. Most fuelwood users currently manage trees to produce firewood in the form of fuelwood sticks, not large logs. Appropriate fuelwood production systems should be developed, based on the principles of coppicing and pollarding, short rotation periods, and producing small diameter fuelwood sticks. A hypothetical fuelstick project is discussed to show that not only are such systems possible, but they can be economically superior to conventional solutions.","shortTitle":"Fuelwood production in developing countries","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Van Gelder","given":"A"},{"family":"Hosier","given":"R"},{"family":"Van der Donk","given":"W"},{"family":"Beijer Inst.","given":"International Inst. for Energy and Human Ecology"},{"family":"Dept. of Forest Tech. and Forest Products","given":"Agricultural Univ. of the Netherlands"}],"issued":{"raw":"1983"}}]}

Classification categories include the nature of the supply system\u2019s setting; the type of energy supplied ; the type of solar energy collection system used (including \u2018 indirect \u2019 solar energy, such as wind and hydropower) ; the type of energy stored ; and some other characteristics of the storage system. A global insolation summary is used to exhibit the diversity of requirements for solar energy storage in different settings. Comments are then made on the need and opportunities for 24 hr storage of electrical energy in batteries; backup systems that use stored chemical fuel derived from solar energy; storage of intermediate temperature heat as heat of hydration of compounds such as sulfuric acid; annual storage of low temperature heat in fresh water ponds or aquifers; and annual storage of ice produced in places with cold winters. Arguments are presented for using a systems approach to the selection of solar energy storage methods appropriate for use in specific types of settings.","URL":"http:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/811328717411l136\/abstract\/","DOI":"10.1007\/BF02848929","author":[{"family":"Taylor","given":"Theodore"}],"issued":{"raw":"1979"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-07-11"}}]}

Using Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, as a case study, this article interrogates de Soto\u2019s claims about the causes of informality and the benefits of formal title. The article concludes that de Soto\u2019s analysis is problematic in three distinct respects. First, de Soto exaggerates the benefits of formal title and fails to consider its risks. Second, de Soto constructs informality as a uniquely Third World phenomenon, and neglects to address the growth of poverty, inequality, and informality in both the global North and the global South as a consequence of deregulation, privatization, and other neoliberal economic reforms that de Soto advocates. Third, de Soto\u2019s attribution of informality to the failure of law in the global South reinforces the narrative of Latin American inferiority, thereby justifying the imposition of disadvantageous market-oriented legal reforms on Latin American nations and discrediting Latin America legal innovations that might better alleviate poverty and address the shortage of affordable housing.Contrary to de Soto\u2019s policy prescriptions, the benefits of formality and informality must be evaluated on a case by case basis. De Soto\u2019s ideas are dangerous to the extent that they persuade policy-makers that the \u201cfree market\u201d will solve the problem or poverty and housing scarcity if the urban poor are simply given legal title to the lands they currently occupy informally.","URL":"http:\/\/works.bepress.com\/carmen_gonzalez\/9","shortTitle":"Squatters, Pirates, and Entrepreneurs","author":[{"family":"Gonzalez","given":"Carmen G"}],"issued":{"raw":"2009"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-07-11"}}]}

In this framework, potential rents associated with more exclusivity drives \"demand\" for commons arrangements but demand is not a sufficient explanation; norms and politics matter. At some point enhanced scarcity will drive demand for more exclusivity beyond which can be sustained with commons arrangements. Claimants will therefore petition government for de jure property rights to their claims - formal titles. Land conflict will be minimal when governments supply property rights to first possessors. But, governments may not allocate de jure rights to these claimants because they face differing political constituencies. Moreover, governments may assign de jure rights but be unwilling to enforce the right. This generates potential or actual conflict over land depending on the violence potentials of de facto and de jure claimants. We examine land settlement and conflict on the frontiers of Australia, the U.S. and Brazil. We are interested in examining the emergence, sustainability, and collapse of commons arrangements in specific historical contexts. Our analysis indicates the emergence of de facto property rights arrangements will be relatively peaceful where claimants have reasons to organize collectively (Australia and the U.S.). The settlement process will be more prone to conflict when fewer collective activities are required. Consequently, claimants resort to periodic violent self-enforcement or third party enforcement (Brazil). In all three cases the movement from de facto to de jure property rights led to potential or actual conflict because of insufficient government enforcement.","shortTitle":"De facto and de jure property rights","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Alston","given":"Lee J"},{"family":"Harris","given":"Edwyna Margaret"},{"family":"Mueller","given":"Bernardo"},{"family":"National Bureau of Economic Research","given":""}],"issued":{"raw":"2009"}}]}

This apparatus took form in the struggle to subdue the peasantry in the 1930s. Its basic means for managing agricultural production (and, to some extent, industrial production as well), is the mobilizational campaign. But campaigns are by nature intermittent and thus ineffective at eliciting subtle, long-term changes in organizational or individual behavior. For perestroika to succeed, alternative instruments for policy implementation which offer effective political and economic incentives for increased production must be developed.

The case of downtown Manhattan during these years, however, challenges this assumption. Student radicals at New York University in Greenwich Village were just as concerned with issues of urban equity and the politics of urban space as they were with more national concerns, such as ending the Vietnam War. NYU students advocated that the university offer open admissions and free tuition to any New Yorker who wished to attend and fought against what they perceived to be the university's imperialistic management of Bellevue Hospital. In this paper, I consider the ways in which late 1960s radicals in downtown Manhattan negotiated how a city should be constituted, and I argue that, in challenging the concrete city conditions that they deemed to be indicative of larger systemic problems, these radicals' activism represents not only a piece of 1960s radical history but also a chapter of local urban history. Manhattan radicalism in the 1960s was predicated on the urban environment that it was a part of, and a consideration of the radical efforts to reconstruct the postwar city is essential to understanding period radicalism and the development of cities. The rapid and transformative changes in American metropolitan areas after the Second World War and the leftist radicalism that is the hallmark of the decade are narratives that commentators often tell as two different, unrelated stories, even though, in the case of New York City, student activism had everything to do with the postwar city. My examination of radicals' work to enact local change takes steps toward furthering the efforts of a generation of scholars who have tried to complicate our view of \"the sixties.\" (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]\nDans l'imaginaire populaire, le radicalisme des ann\u00e9es soixante semble souvent un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne peu variable d'une r\u00e9gion \u00e0 une autre. Cependant, en consid\u00e9rant la situation des quartiers du sud de Manhattan, cette supposition est remise en question. Les \u00e9tudiants radicaux de New York University (NYU) \u00e0 Greenwich Village \u00e9taient autant concern\u00e9s par des enjeux d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 urbaine et la politique de d\u00e9veloppement urbain que par des sujets nationaux, comme mettre un terme \u00e0 la guerre du Vietnam. Les \u00e9tudiants de NYU ont lutt\u00e9 pour des admissions plus ouvertes et l'annulation des droits de scolarit\u00e9 pour tous les New Yorkais qui souhaitaient aller \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9. Ils combattaient ce qu'ils percevaient comme de l'imp\u00e9rialisme de la part de l'Universit\u00e9 dans la gestion de l'h\u00f4pital Bellevue. Dans cet article, j'aborde les mani\u00e8res par lesquelles les radicaux de Manhattan des ann\u00e9es soixante ont d\u00e9termin\u00e9 comment une ville devait \u00eatre constitu\u00e9e. Je soutiens qu'en contestant les conditions urbaines, ils ont mis en lumi\u00e8re des probl\u00e8mes syst\u00e9miques plus larges. L'activisme de ces radicaux ne constitue pas seulement une partie de l'histoire radicale des ann\u00e9es soixante, mais aussi un chapitre de l'histoire locale et urbaine. Le radicalisme de Manhattan dans les ann\u00e9es soixante est ench\u00e2ss\u00e9 dans le milieu urbain dans lequel il se trouve et une analyse des efforts radicaux de red\u00e9velopper la ville dans l'apr\u00e8s-guerre est essentielle pour comprendre le radicalisme de cette p\u00e9riode et le d\u00e9veloppement des villes. Les changements rapides qu'ont connu les r\u00e9gions m\u00e9tropolitaines des Etats-Unis apr\u00e8s la Seconde Guerre mondiale et le radicalisme gauchiste qui est caract\u00e9ristique des ann\u00e9es soixante sont des r\u00e9cits que souvent les chercheurs consid\u00e8rent comme distincts, sans rapports entre eux, m\u00eame si, dans le cas de New York City, l'activisme des \u00e9tudiants \u00e9tait partie int\u00e9grante de la ville de l'apr\u00e8s-guerre. Mon analyse des radicaux et de leur action afin de provoquer des changements locaux accentue les efforts d'une g\u00e9n\u00e9ration de chercheurs qui ont essay\u00e9 de complexifier notre fa\u00e7on d'examiner et de comprendre \u00ab les ann\u00e9es soixante \u00bb.

The landlord lobby typically trots out small-property owners as the public face of the anti-rent control campaign, \"Mom and Pop\" landlords beleaguered by a bureaucracy that protects affluent tenants. But in fact fat cats dominate the real estate forces. Over the past five years they dramatically increased campaign contributions to the state Grand Old Party and its candidates, making the industry one of the biggest donors in state politics. Last year the Neighborhood Preservation Political Action Fund (PAC) and the Real Estate Board PAC, both major industry groups, were the fourth and sixth-largest contributors to state legislative races, according to a report by the New York Public Interest Research Group. The landlord-sponsored Rent Stabilization Association PAC, which was formed in 1992 and has given about $750,000 to state candidates and party committees, was not far behind.","call-number":"9706203948","author":[{"family":"Dreier","given":"Peter"}],"issued":{"raw":"June 23, 1997"}}]}

The history of housing reform has been dominated by a de haut en bas perspective in which the primacy of prescient bureaucrats and pragmatic politicians has, until recently, been unquestioned. This approach gained an added plausibility from the fact that so much of the social history of labour has centred upon the worker as producer rather than consumer. There are signs that this is now beginning to change. Recent research suggests that not only is popular opinion not irrecoverable but that the interventions of organised tenants have been of greater significance in the formation of housing policy than was previously thought. This article is a modest contribution to the new revisionism. Hitherto, historians of Birmingham have been more concerned with the form rather than the politics of municipal housing. This essay, by contrast, will focus upon the various associations of working class tenants that comprised the Birmingham and District Tenants' Federation. Its objects are twofold: to explain their activities and assess their importance.","shortTitle":"TENANTS AND POLITICS","author":[{"family":"Englander","given":"David"}],"issued":{"raw":"1981-01-01T00:00:00"}}]}

Many Pullman workers, however, lived outside the borders of Pullman proper, and the circumstances of their participation in union activity reflected their own ethnically diverse backgrounds and neighborhoods. The human geography of Pullman changed over time, as waves of immigrants increased the ethnic and racial diversity of the region. While the Pullman company remained a major employer for many decades, the residents of the surrounding area viewed their interests in ways that reflected both their local communities and working conditions.","call-number":"9356368","author":[{"family":"Reiff","given":"Janice L."}],"issued":{"raw":"Spring 2000"}}]}

Scotland's land tenure was feudal until the late twentieth century. Plutocratic ownership impacted the economics and psychology of community well-being. The 1990s produced a land reform movement culminating in the new Scottish Parliament's Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 and the Land\n                     Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. These created a conditional 'community right to buy' and affirmed the freedom of 'right to roam'. Two percent of Scottish land is now in community ownership. Our research interviewed fifteen movers and shakers--both national theologians and local activists from the vanguard land trusts of Eigg, Assynt, and Gigha. We conclude that spirituality and religion can be subtle drivers of community empowerment. By inspiring, informing, and\n                     legitimising socio-political transformation, a 'Remnant' theology was factored into Scottish legislation of international significance.

In contrast, this article shows that development practitioners and institutions were already addressing poverty and social issues in the late 1940s and early 1950s. However, economic multilateral organizations soon marginalized those inclusive views and focused exclusively on economic growth. This article discusses those early policy options and why they were marginalized. It argues that this happened for ideological reasons, specifically because of the ideological anti-New Deal post-war backlash and the adhesion of Western countries and multilateral organizations to what Charles Maier defined as the politics of productivity. This ideological backlash explains the rise and early demise of Keynesian ideas in international organizations, and, conversely, their stronger influence in developing countries, where the direct influence of the US and Bretton Woods organizations was somewhat mitigated.","DOI":"10.1017\/S1740022811000040","shortTitle":"The World Bank and the Politics of Productivity","author":[{"family":"Alacevich","given":"Michele"}],"issued":{"raw":"2011"}}]}

This paper argues that the root causes have been in place for much longer, making that decline both predictable and inevitable. I draw on the work of those who argue that Britain has always had a greater concern for wealth preservation than for wealth creation. The period since 1979-80 has been a particularly difficult one in which to reinstitute industrial growth. Present conditions have, to an unprecedented degree, favored speculation over investment, short-termism over long-termism.","URL":"http:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/144500","DOI":"10.2307\/144500","note":"ArticleType: research-article \/ Full publication date: Jan., 1996 \/ Copyright \u00a9 1996 Clark University","author":[{"family":"Hallsworth","given":"Alan G."}],"issued":{"raw":"January 01, 1996"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-07-04"}}]}

Accelerating property prices provided the rationale behind the property boom in 1970 and facilitated the overvaluation of property assets against which the banks provided finance to the property companies. The expansion of bank lending to the property sector, the initiation of the slump by the failure of a bank involved in the sector, the reaction of government and creditors to the crisis, and its long-term redistributive effects, are all encompassed in Veblen's analysis.","call-number":"9603276287","shortTitle":"The New Alchemy","author":[{"family":"Scott","given":"Peter"}],"issued":{"raw":"March 1996"}}]}

Horwitz's The Transformation of American Law, 1780-1860 is considered one of the most significant works ever published in American legal history. Since its publication in 1977, it has become the standard source on early nineteenth-century American law. In this monumental book, Morton J. Horwitz offers a sweeping overview of the emergence of our national (and modern) legal system from English and colonial antecedents. He begins with the common law, which emerged during the eighteenth century as the standard doctrine with which to solve disputes in an egalitarian manner. He shows that the turning point in the use of common law came after 1790, when the law was slowly transformed to favor economic growth and development, and the courts began to spur economic competition rather than circumscribe it. This new instrumental law would flourish during the nineteenth century as the legal profession and the mercantile elite forged a mutually beneficial alliance to gain wealth and power. Horwitz also demonstrates how the emergence of contract law corresponded to the development of economic and legal institutions of exchange. And he discusses how the rise of the market economy influenced legal practices, how contracts became ways to negate preexisting common law duties, and how (to the benefit of entrepreneurs and commercial groups) the courts were able to overthrow earlier anticommercial legal rules. Previous historical studies have viewed law and policy as an accurate reflection of the needs of an undifferentiated society. In The Transformation of American Law, Horwitz successfully challenges this misconception and shows how, in theeighty years after the American Revolution, a major change in law took place in which aspects of social struggle turned to legal channels for resolution. Looking into the distribution of wealth and power during this time, Horwitz finds indeed that the change in legal ideology enabled commercial groups to win a disproportionate amount of wealth and power in American society. An accessible account of the history of law, this is a powerful statement on the great role of the legal system in American economic development.","ISBN":"9780674903715","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Horwitz","given":"Morton J."}],"issued":{"raw":"1977"}}]}

[ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]","note":"Source: Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition, 11\/1\/2011 ; Agrarian reform ; Agrarian reform, redistribution of the agricultural resources of a country. Traditionally, agrarian, or land, reform is confined to the redistribution of land; in a broader sense it includes related changes in agricultural institutions, including credit, taxation, rents, and cooperatives. Although agrarian reform can result in lower agricultural productivity, especially if it includes collectivization, it may increase productivity when land is redistributed to the tiller.                      Pressure for modern land reform is most powerful in the underdeveloped nations. See also collective farm. ; History ; Agrarian reform has been a recurrent theme in history. The Greek and Roman eras were filled with violent struggles between landowners and the landless. The land reform issue was a major factor in the Gracchian agrarian laws. During the Middle Ages, demands for land reform triggered peasant rebellions, including the Peasants' Revolt in England led by John Ball and Wat Tyler in 1381 and the German Peasants' War of 1524-26. ; Russia ; In the 20th cent. the Russian Revolution added a new dimension to agrarian reform--the socialization of agriculture (i.e., the collective ownership of all land partly through state farming, but mainly through collective farming under state control) as a prerequisite for attaining communism. Driven in part by the peasant's desire for land, Lenin, shortly after assuming power, decreed (1917) all land as state property. Landed estates were seized by peasants, resulting in                      approximately 25 million peasant holdings. His government's promotion of voluntary collectivization was ineffective, however, and after 1929 Stalin forced collectivization at an estimated cost of ten million lives. After World War II, the Eastern European nations under Communist rule implemented agrarian reforms following the Soviet model. Since the collapse of Communist rule in Eastern Europe (1989-90) and the disintegration of the Soviet Union (1991) there has                      been movement, sometimes successful, sometimes fitful, toward privatization of agriculture in the former republics of the USSR.; China ; China's Communist revolution in 1949 led, after the wholesale transfer of land to small peasants, to the amalgation of peasant cooperatives into larger communes (1958). An attempt to establish socialist agriculture prior to mechanization, the communes were much criticized by the Soviet Union. They proved inefficient, causing stagnation in agricultural productivity, and China later abolished them. By 1980 China was rapidly returning land to individual smallholders and promoting                      market-oriented agriculture with marked success.; In Other Parts of the World ; In Asia, especially in such densely populated areas as the Indian subcontinent, agitation has been mainly for redistribution among landless laborers; for security of tenure; and for the elimination of middlemen, oppressive rents, and usurious interest. Agrarian reforms began in Japan during the Meiji Restoration (1868-1912), when feudal fiefs and stipends were abolished. After World War II, U.S. occupation forces supervised further land reform. As a result, by 1949 over 80% of                      Japan's tenanted land had been transferred from absentee landlords to tenant cultivators. In India and Pakistan similar programs of agrarian reform were attempted, with less success (see Bhave, Vinoba).; In S Africa, where racial policies resulted in discriminatory land policies in Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, majority rule in the late 20th cent. led to pressure for land redistribution. In Zimbabwe, wholesale land redistribution at the end of the 1900s resulted in near collapse of the country's commercial agriculture when land was transferred from white farmers to blacks who had little farming experience and inadequate equipment. Land reform has proceeded more gradually                      in Namibia and South Africa, resulting in greater frustration on the part of the landless but less significant decreases in agricultural production.; Latin America and Africa ; In South America land reform is a major problem because enormous tracts of land (latifundios) are concentrated in very few hands with laborers no better off than serfs. Although the revolution in Mexico resulted in land reform (1917), the program of redistribution of land is still only partially completed. A land reform law also followed the Bolivian revolution of 1952, but by 1970 only 45% of the peasant families had received titles to land. One of the most complete agrarian                      reforms in Latin America has taken place in Cuba, where land reform was one of the main platforms of the revolution of 1959. Large holdings were expropriated by the National Institute for Land Reform (INRA), but most is managed by government officials and has not been redistributed. The remaining agricultural land is limited to a ceiling with tenants gaining ownership rights. Nicaragua's agrarian reform under the Sandinistas resulted in expropriation of some large                      holdings (1979), which after initial collectivization has been progressively redistributed to individual farmers, including returning Contras after 1989. Chile's land reform (1970-73) was reversed when Socialist Salvador Allende was overthrown.; African agrarian reforms have included distribution of excess land (Algeria, 1971); nationalization of all land (Ethiopia, 1974); and abolition of all land titles to be replaced by rights of occupancy (Tanzania, Zambia and Nigeria). Tanzania promoted farming collectives (ujamaa) with limited success. ; Bibliography ; See D. Ghai and S. Radwan, ed., Agrarian Policies and Rural Poverty in Africa (1983); C. C. Geisler and F. J.

Because American society needs to find new means to finance transportation capital investment, particularly public transit, value capture offers an essentially painless opportunity to achieve these goals. It has the ancillary benefit also of concentrating population densities in a way that makes public transit particularly viable. This study shows how value capture could have been used to finance a portion of the New York State Interstate Highway System, a nine-mile stretch of I-87 known as the Northway, from its southern terminus to the point where it crosses the Mohawk River in Albany County. This section is the most heavily traveled area of the Northway and has experienced the greatest contiguous development of any location along the Northway's 178 miles since its construction in the late 1950s. While the right of way and construction costs of this stretch were in the range of $128 million (current dollars), the additional land value that has been generated on its account within just two miles on either side has totaled $3.734 billion. This study shows that the capital finance of the Northway, at least in this area, could easily have been done by recapturing these windfall gains that fell to private landowners. One could argue that this added value, the direct result of public investment, should rightfully be returned to the public and should be recaptured to pay off the bonds that were issued to build the project, rather than left for opportunistic speculators to reap private gain. Value capture therefore offers a promising approach for funding future transportation development, leaving fees, that are presently used, to recover operating and environmental costs.","URL":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu\/doi\/10.1111\/1536-7150.00061\/abstract","DOI":"10.1111\/1536-7150.00061","shortTitle":"Value Capture as a Policy Tool in Transportation Economics","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Batt","given":"H.

Evans promoted quantitative restrictions on land ownership, while George was known for his advocacy of a single tax on land. The New York Shakers, as large land owners, successfully resisted early G. H. Evans-type land reforms. Later, Shakers led by F. W. Evans embraced Henry George-type policy proposals and supported George for mayor of New York City. F. W. Evans himself, however, conflated Henry George's proposals with those of his brother, never realizing the contradiction between the two, much less resolving it.

This article shows that underlying this policy prescription is the assumption that institutions for pooling and spreading production risks are perfect. When account is taken of the imperfections in those institutions, some use of output taxes will be Pareto superior to a pure land tax regime and may induce higher output, as well. Henry George was wrong! These results generally apply even when the land tax is indexed to regional output, and when land is farmed under sharecropping. Even in these cases, a move from a pure land tax to a mix of land and low output taxes will reduce preexisting distortions in both consumption and production arising from the imperfection in risk markets.","URL":"http:\/\/wber.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/5\/1\/93","DOI":"10.1093\/wber\/5.1.93","journalAbbreviation":"World Bank Econ Rev","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Hoff","given":"Karla"}],"issued":{"raw":"01\/01\/1991"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-06-29"}}]}

In the spring of 1841, Thoreau started to build a hut with his own hands on the shores of Walden Pond. Thoreau claimed he had \"found that the student who wishes for a shelter can obtain one for a life time at an expense not greater than the rent which he now pays annually.\" Without any advance planning, Thoreau moved in triumphantly on July 4, 1845. He records in his book \"Walden\" the expense accounts for the first eight months. He earned by surveying, carpentry and day labor in the village, $13.34. He said he had as many trades as he had fingers. For the brief period of only a little more than two years, Thoreau lived at Walden Pond. He had only to get clothing and fuel. He could generally barter for food, avoiding trade. Here was a scholar who was in search of simple means of support. Hence, he made an experiment in independent living through subsistence farming. His explorations of the rich treasures of nature were considerably enhanced. He wrote a notable, book recording the experience, including expositions of his own philosophy of life.","call-number":"15408785","author":[{"family":"Landis","given":"Benson Y."}],"issued":{"raw":"April 1945"}}]}

The use of structured questionnaires provides data about the distribution and characteristics of social networks of squatters' closest friends (amigos de confianza) as well as other individuals who are approached for moral support and cash loans. Data are analysed according to socio-economic criteria to shed light upon social interaction behaviour among low-income groups. Socio-economic status rather than cultural attributes underpin interaction patterns and findings suggest that social networks of the very poor are more locally oriented. This is particularly marked for females who see each other on a daily or multiple-daily basis more often than their better-off counter-parts. All groups select kin for moral support and will overcome physical distance for this purpose. Interaction behaviour differs markedly between males and females while observed differences between settlement is largely a product of the different household structures that emerge with the integration of each community. The degree to which squatters are extra-local for the purpose of entertainment strongly reflects economic status.","URL":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/0016718578900015","DOI":"10.1016\/0016-7185(78)90001-5","author":[{"family":"Ward","given":"Peter M."}],"issued":{"raw":"1978"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-06-29"}}]}

These are all subjected to a critical examination, and a Marxist framework is suggested as a more effective means of analysing the problems and policies under discussion. The debate between \u2018state-assisted self-help\u2019 and \u2018official housing\u2019 policies is situated in the context of the conflicting interests of the different fractions of capital tied to the housing process. Turner's policies, it is argued, could only be implemented alongside rather than instead of, existing State policies, and never on the scale and in the manner considered critical to their success.","URL":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/0305750X78900670","DOI":"10.1016\/0305-750X(78)90067-0","shortTitle":"Petty commodity housing or dweller control?","author":[{"family":"Burgess","given":"Rod"}],"issued":{"raw":"September 1978"}}]}

{"items":[{"id":"559764\/U3NSVGVZ","type":"webpage","title":"Agrarian reform in Venezuela : defensible from a socio-economic perspective?","abstract":"The land reform in Venezuela was introduced in 2001 and will according to its proponents decrease the countrys oil dependency through increasing agricultural production. The law also intends to decrease inequalities in the society by giving land to landless peasants. To achieve this, a land tax will be introduced on unproductive land and land can also be expropriated or repossessed by the state. The land reform has been criticised a lot and its opponents believe the reform will result in a major flight of capital as well as decreasing investments because of insecurity and consequently less agricultural production. The aim of this paper is to find out whether this land reform could be defensible from a socio-economic perspective. To achieve the aim the starting point has been economic theories of how an agrarian reform could be conducted in an economically defensible way and focus has been on efficiency, investments and inequality. Further an interview study in Venezuela in the autumn of 2005 has been carried through. Does the Venezuelan land reform comply with the theoretical design? There are different opinions about this. Generally could be claimed that it does not comply with the traditional theories about efficiency, however, if the models are somewhat modified and under certain assumptions the reform might be defensible from an efficiency point of view. When it comes to investments it is uncertain whether they will increase because of secured property rights for the peasants or decrease because of the insecurity that large landowners experience. The final outcome will depend on how the law will be interpreted as well as to what extent the peasants will receive support. The reform will probably reduce inequalities in Venezuela, which could be favourable for the economy but this could also increase insecurity for investors. Further some practical problems might prevent a positive development.","URL":"http:\/\/ex-epsilon.slu.se:8080\/archive\/00001459\/","shortTitle":"Agrarian reform in Venezuela","language":"English","author":[{"family":"St\u00e5lberg","given":"Annie"}],"issued":{"raw":"2006"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-06-27"}}]}

More important, the analysis of famine is inseparable from the problems of agricultural technology, inequality, and dependence in normal times.

This article argues that their function was about more than mere adornment. Through their presence, lineages of political longevity were established and memories of the radical past invoked. This article considers the totemic role of the &lsquo;old Chartists&rsquo;. It locates their significance for successor movements, and scrutinizes their importance in augmenting and modifying the historiography of Chartism. It argues that the personal stories of veteran Chartists were formative for later depictions of the movement, and remain integral to the creation of a radical historiography mediated through the lived experience of struggle, and the historical memory of reform. By engaging with recent &lsquo;continuity&rsquo; debates in the historiography of nineteenth-century popular politics, this article argues that the role of the veteran Chartist contributed to a radical inter-generational history of reform that frequently remained independent of both liberalism and Toryism.","shortTitle":"\u2018The Old Chartist\u2019","language":"English","author":[{"family":"TAYLOR","given":"ANTONY"}],"issued":{"raw":"2010"}}]}

The report is largely based on an interpretation of preexisting literature and data but also encompasses the findings from a few previously unreported case studies carried out over the period 1973-75. The report provides a brief overview of the extent to which land reform measures have been implemented--the acreages and the number of beneficiaries involved--in each country. More importantly, the report distinguishes between land reforms which have occurred at different stages of agricultural development and under different pre-existing land tenure structures and types of post-reform organization. With typologies of this kind, it has been possible to make some preliminary judgments about the effects various land reform and associated policies might have for general agricultural development and income distribution in alternative environments.","number":"No. 275","author":[{"family":"Eckstein, S.","given":""},{"family":"Donald, G","given":""},{"family":"Horton, D.","given":""}],"issued":{"raw":"April 1978"}}]}

Although giving support to the flat, it was also intended to re\u2010introduce the house as a major element in the redevelopment of all but the west\u2010central parts of London. After the war, however, with a few notable exceptions, the London Plan version of mixed development failed to become established in practice. This was due partly to the re\u2010opening of divisions which the Plans had sought to close. But it was also due to the manner in which the debate linked to mainstream political and financial concerns, and this is the aspect on which the article concentrates. In particular, it examines the development of the subsidy structure and its links with planning concerns and local politics. The discussion relates to the significance of the land values issue to war\u2010time planning, the failure to achieve a full solution, the \u2018return to reality\u2019 during and after the war, and the continuities between pre\u2010war and post\u2010war periods.","URL":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/02665439408725793","DOI":"10.1080\/02665439408725793","author":[{"family":"Yelling","given":"J.A."}],"issued":{"raw":"1994"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-06-08"}}]}

At the same time, some contemporaries regarded such destruction as an opportunity not only for the reconstruction of the built environment but also for the creation of a fairer society. The replanning of the blitzed areas became a symbol of the aspiration to build a New Jerusalem.\nThis article examines the fate of radical town planning ideas in the 1940s and the early 1950s with particular reference to the rebuilding of heavily bombed cities. It analyses the visions which inspired reconstruction plans, examines their conception and studies the visionaries, both ordinary citizens and the political elite.\nThe process of postwar reconstruction in general has become a much-debated subject in political, economic and social history in recent years, but there has been a serious lack of detailed examination of postwar urban replanning and redevelopment. This article, therefore, also considers how the rebuilding of war-damaged cities should be evaluated in the light of the contemporary political, economic, and social realities and issues during the period of postwar reconstruction.","URL":"http:\/\/tcbh.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/10\/2\/137","DOI":"10.1093\/tcbh\/10.2.137","journalAbbreviation":"Twentieth Century Brit Hist","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Hasegawa","given":"Junichi"}],"issued":{"raw":"01\/01\/1999"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-06-08"}}]}

I also argue that town planning is an integral part of the land and property market which itself is conditioned by the definition of the rights in land and property. These rights are shown to be grounded in the traditions of the private land law as evolved over centuries from the feudal system of land and property relations. I therefore begin with an examination of development under the leasehold system in London during the 18th and 19th centuries and find that landowners, in their efforts of maintaining the value of their estate, conducted a form of environmental control very similar to what planners do nowadays as part of their activities in development control. It is then shown how the old system was unable to cope with the pressures of industrialisation and rapidly expanding urban areas. Politicians, royal commissions, and expert committees sought to adapt the leasehold system and to reform existing property rights to accommodate a newly emerging property market. These efforts finally culminated in the 1925 Property Statutes. At the same time governments pursued efforts of devising new structures of urban governance. However, these measures generally were piecemeal and their implementation was fraught with difficulties. A new approach, recognising the interdependence between market processes, market regulation, and 'public improvement', were championed by the radical Liberals towards the end of the 19th century. This philosophy is reflected in the enactment of the first planning statutes of 1909 and 1919. Both Acts made provisions for the retainment of development value for reasons of social justice and the funding of urban infrastructure. Subsequent enactments have tended to isolate town planning not only from housing but also from the land market and the issue of betterment, and thus from urban governance. The reason, it is argued, is that property as well as planning legislation are still hemmed in the straitjacket of the private land law. I conclude that the isolation of town planning within a fragmented 'public domain' bodes ill for the future of our cities.","URL":"http:\/\/www.envplan.com\/abstract.cgi?id=a291399","DOI":"10.1068\/a291399","author":[{"family":"Luithlen","given":"L."}],"issued":{"raw":"1997"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-06-08"}}]}

This paper reviews the controversial nature of public landownership, discusses some of the reasons for it and examines the shortage of reliable information. It then reports on a detailed empirical study of one city, Manchester, and provides an account of the extent and pattern of public land holdings. Fourteen separate public bodies are shown to account for 65 per cent of the land in the city. The pattern of public landownership has had a profound impact upon the developing urban form.","URL":"http:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/622504","DOI":"10.2307\/622504","note":"ArticleType: research-article \/ Full publication date: 1988 \/ Copyright \u00a9 1988 The Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers)","author":[{"family":"Kivell","given":"P.

The paper reviews the arguments as they have been developed by Utopians, Economists, Popularisers and Politicians. It argues that, though current problems are different from those addressed in the past, the history of the idea of communal ownership still offers insights that have current relevance. As far as rural land is concerned, the problems associated with ownership rights are those that relate either to non-market effects or to the \u2018unearned increment\u2019 or to landlord\/tenant relationships. Suggestions are made as to the part that changes in property rights might play in handling these problems today.\u2018To whomsoever the soil at any time belongs, to him belong the fruits of it.

Although giving support to the flat, it was also intended to re\u2010introduce the house as a major element in the redevelopment of all but the west\u2010central parts of London. After the war, however, with a few notable exceptions, the London Plan version of mixed development failed to become established in practice. This was due partly to the re\u2010opening of divisions which the Plans had sought to close. But it was also due to the manner in which the debate linked to mainstream political and financial concerns, and this is the aspect on which the article concentrates. In particular, it examines the development of the subsidy structure and its links with planning concerns and local politics. The discussion relates to the significance of the land values issue to war\u2010time planning, the failure to achieve a full solution, the \u2018return to reality\u2019 during and after the war, and the continuities between pre\u2010war and post\u2010war periods.","URL":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/02665439408725793","DOI":"10.1080\/02665439408725793","author":[{"family":"Yelling","given":"J.A."}],"issued":{"raw":"1994"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-06-08"}}]}

Emilio Gentile has provided detailed criteria to distinguish \u2018political religion\u2019 from \u2018civil religion\u2019 and \u2018politicised religion\u2019 from \u2018religion as politics\u2019. This paper tries to apply this taxonomy to late Victorian and Edwardian socialism in Britain. Intellectual arguments for a \u2018religion of socialism\u2019\u2013 as well as less-theorised religious behaviour \u2013 are evident within three groupings that shaped the British socialist revival: the Social Democratic Federation, The Fabian Society, and the Independent Labour Party. Surveying members of each, including Ernest Belfort Bax, the Webbs, Shaw, Wells; John Trevor, and Keir Hardie, the paper lastly turns to Edward Carpenter, who moved between the aforementioned groups during his career, and whose popular and influential writings vividly capture socialism\u2019s spiritual character. His case also illustrates the major obstacle in applying Gentile\u2019s taxonomy to this period, namely the pervasive monism of the age, which blurs concepts of the temporal and divine. In conclusion, we can see that Edwardian socialism provided good conditions for the emergence of political religion but also for the civil religion of today\u2019s centre left. A much more detailed discussion, beyond our scope here, might consider Gentile\u2019s distinctions between functionalist, manipulative, noumenal forms of religiosity; distinctions brought home to Edwardian intellectuals through new theories of charisma and crowd psychology. Their knowledge, and application, of these ideas more clearly anticipates the rise of fascism; although, in the same generation, we should note a return to dualism as a defence against totalitarian political religion.","URL":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1749-8171.2010.00244.x\/abstract","DOI":"10.1111\/j.1749-8171.2010.00244.x","shortTitle":"Edwardian Intellectuals and Political Religions","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Mead","given":"Henry"}],"issued":{"raw":"2010"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-06-07"}}]}

It shows that in both their analysis and their activities the Fellowship were very much of the socialist mainstream in their day. They rejected the dichotomies of their society, such as individual-society, ends-means and materialism- ethicalism, and they sought to combine these facets of life in both their thought and their political campaigns. The conclusion reached is that this complex, resourceful and potent group have been ill-served by being given the simplistic and pejorative label of 'ethical' socialism.","shortTitle":"THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE NEW LIFE","author":[{"family":"Manton K.","given":""}],"issued":{"raw":"2003"}}]}

This brought the need for greater bureaucratic machinery which would connect individual farmers and their communities with central government. Crucial from 1939 in this respect was the formation of the County War Agricultural Executive Committees, which became the channels through which English farming was propelled into postwar productivism. Using relatively newly-available documentary material, this article demonstrates the role the committees played in the transmission of national policies down to the local level, their composition and membership. In so doing it also places the economic changes within farming into the vital but under-researched context of their rural social relations during the Second World War.","DOI":"10.1017\/S0956793307002166","shortTitle":"War in the Fields and Villages","author":[{"family":"Short","given":"Brian"}],"issued":{"raw":"2007"}}]}

In the 1950s Labour promised to \u2018municipalize\u2019 all rent-controlled dwellings, some six million houses and flats. After municipalization proved electorally unattractive in 1959 Labour turned to the idea of a Land Commission to purchase all commercially developable land at 30 per cent more than its \u2018use value\u2019. That land would then be leased to developers, thus realizing most of the \u2018unearned increment\u2019 for the state. Labour's promise to use the Land Commission to control land speculation and end rising prices in land contributed to Harold Wilson's victory in 1964, although in the event the Land Commission failed to realize its promise. In addition to adding a neglected dimension to the history of the Labour Party in these decades, this article argues that the issue of land reform shows the continued radicalism of the Labour Party, the continued strength of the ethical tradition in its socialism, and the continued hold on its members of a vision for social transformation.","URL":"http:\/\/tcbh.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/19\/3\/314","DOI":"10.1093\/tcbh\/hwn016","shortTitle":"Labour and the Land","journalAbbreviation":"Twentieth Century Brit Hist","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Weiler","given":"Peter"}],"issued":{"raw":"01\/01\/2008"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-06-07"}}]}

The wartime controversy over land reform reached a climax during the second half of 1944 following the publication of the Government's Town and Country Planning Bill and the White Paper on Control of Land\u2010Use. Up until 1945 the Labour Party supported a policy of land nationalization, but this was not included in the manifesto for the 1945 General Election. This article will argue that the Labour Party abandoned a policy of land nationalization not because it feared the creation of internal divisions or damaging its electoral chances (support for land nationalization was anyway running high in the opinion polls), but that it was responding to pressure from Labour local government for more immediate housing and town planning reform.","URL":"http:\/\/tcbh.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/14\/2\/165","DOI":"10.1093\/tcbh\/14.2.165","shortTitle":"The Conflict over Property Rights during the Second World War","journalAbbreviation":"Twentieth Century Brit Hist","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Tichelar","given":"Michael"}],"issued":{"raw":"01\/01\/2003"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-06-07"}}]}

From accounting for only five percent of the value of Chile's total exports in the late 1960s, agricultural exports grew to account for more than 30 percent of this value in the mid 1990s. Using a modified neoclassical growth formulation, we show that the transformation of the Chilean agricultural sector can be associated with institutional changes or modifications to the sector's basic functioning structure. In particular, our historical review shows that changes in the definition of property rights over land, caused by the Chilean agrarian reform first and the general economic reform later, seem to have greatly caused the changes in the sector's levels of investment and production.","URL":"http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/10419\/45656","shortTitle":"The Chilean agricultural transformation during the second half of the twentieth century","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Saravia","given":"Antonio"}],"issued":{"raw":"uuuu"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-06-06"}}]}

These two very different struggles are representative of two important periods in radical politics \u2013 the class politics, tempered by Popular Frontism, that operated in the 1930s, and the new social movement politics of the seventies. In the rent strikes of the 1930s the ultimate goal was Communism. Although the local Party was disproportionately Jewish, Communist theory required an outward looking orientation that embraced the whole of the working class. In the squatting movement of the 1970s political organisers attempted to steer the Bengalis onto the path of black radicalism, championing separate organisation and turning the community inwards. An examination of the implementation and consequences of these different movements can help us to understand the possibilities and problems for the transformation of grass-roots activism into a broader political force, and the processes of political mobilisation of ethnic minority groups.","URL":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0305748804000659","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jhg.2004.07.019","shortTitle":"East End immigrants and the battle for housing","author":[{"family":"Glynn","given":"S."}],"issued":{"raw":"July 2005"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-06-05"}}]}

The Drama of Capital: Risk, Belief, and Liability on the Victorian Stage","abstract":"This chapter examines Victorian drama and its dealings with risk and liability. Here, The Poor of New York is presented as a striking example of a wider issue: the dramatization of scenes from advanced capitalism, particularly the transformation of financial danger into theatrical display, which occurred diversely on the Victorian stage. Analysing interwoven financial relationships, the chapter establishes the common elements of trust, illusion, and deceit that bound capital and drama together and which were knowingly exploited to produce what is called the capitalist aesthetics of Victorian sensation culture. The cultural form of 19th-century drama is uncannily like capital itself because it is built on appearances, characterised by insoluble contradiction, and defined by extreme forms of distortion: in the age of high capitalism, drama accordingly acquired a peculiar diagnostic power.","shortTitle":"5.
