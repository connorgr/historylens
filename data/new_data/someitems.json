The aim is to dispel the prevalent notion that there is a common reason for the formation of tenants' associations and that they travel a similar evolutionary path. Rather the paper aims to show that tenants' groups are formed for a variety of reasons and can follow a number of paths. It draws particular attention to the actions and attitudes of housing managers and councillors which can have a vital influence on whether tenants' groups can achieve their goals.","URL":"http:\/\/usj.sagepub.com\/content\/29\/5\/709","DOI":"10.1080\/00420989220080651","journalAbbreviation":"Urban Stud","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Caimcross","given":"Liz"},{"family":"Clapham","given":"David"},{"family":"Goodlad","given":"Robina"}],"issued":{"raw":"06\/01\/1992"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-11-14"}}]}

It analyzes the experience of three housing developments converted under the Public Housing Homeownership Demonstration of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Obstacles to conversion included the extensive renovations needed before transfer, the prohibition against involuntary relocation of tenants, the work of generating interest in the cooperatives, and the difficulty of financing. Indicators of the cooperatives\u2019 success are mixed. One faces serious financial problems; the other two are financially sound despite substantial amounts of share payments in arrears. One set of cooperators is largely dissatisfied with living in the cooperative; the other two sets are mildly satisfied. Factors inhibiting greater success included inadequate board training, poor communication between board and residents, lack of participation by cooperators, and the need for major repairs soon after purchase.","URL":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/10511482.1995.9521192","DOI":"10.1080\/10511482.1995.9521192","shortTitle":"Converting public housing to cooperatives","author":[{"family":"Rohe","given":"William M."}],"issued":{"raw":"1995"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-11-14"}}]}

The forms, aims, advocates and development of tenant participation have varied, so that events are not well explained by functionalist theories of the state. While there have been significant economic influences, political and cultural factors (particularly the ideology of consumer expectations) have been very important in putting tenant participation on the agenda of both the tenants\u2019 movement and the state.","URL":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/02673039008720689","DOI":"10.1080\/02673039008720689","author":[{"family":"Hague","given":"Cliff"}],"issued":{"raw":"1990"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-11-14"}}]}

Public consultation in housing formed part of the democratic planning process, as extensive post\u2010war housing provision became a necessity. This article explores the nature of popular opinion on housing and how it may have intersected with the ideas of architects and planners. The results of several opinion surveys suggested that the public held varied, even contradictory, views on the question of housing. Nevertheless, there was a strong demand on its part for better housing affording greater privacy. This was clearly acknowledged by some experts, who tried to take note of these views to produce plans for post\u2010war housing in tune with the public's needs and tastes.","URL":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/13619460008581573","DOI":"10.1080\/13619460008581573","shortTitle":"Planners and the public","author":[{"family":"Tsubaki","given":"Tatsuya"}],"issued":{"raw":"2000"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-11-14"}}]}
