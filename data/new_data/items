In contrast, this article shows that development practitioners and institutions were already addressing poverty and social issues in the late 1940s and early 1950s. However, economic multilateral organizations soon marginalized those inclusive views and focused exclusively on economic growth. This article discusses those early policy options and why they were marginalized. It argues that this happened for ideological reasons, specifically because of the ideological anti-New Deal post-war backlash and the adhesion of Western countries and multilateral organizations to what Charles Maier defined as the politics of productivity. This ideological backlash explains the rise and early demise of Keynesian ideas in international organizations, and, conversely, their stronger influence in developing countries, where the direct influence of the US and Bretton Woods organizations was somewhat mitigated.","DOI":"10.1017\/S1740022811000040","shortTitle":"The World Bank and the Politics of Productivity","author":[{"family":"Alacevich","given":"Michele"}],"issued":{"raw":"2011"}}]}

This paper argues that the root causes have been in place for much longer, making that decline both predictable and inevitable. I draw on the work of those who argue that Britain has always had a greater concern for wealth preservation than for wealth creation. The period since 1979-80 has been a particularly difficult one in which to reinstitute industrial growth. Present conditions have, to an unprecedented degree, favored speculation over investment, short-termism over long-termism.","URL":"http:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/144500","DOI":"10.2307\/144500","note":"ArticleType: research-article \/ Full publication date: Jan., 1996 \/ Copyright \u00a9 1996 Clark University","author":[{"family":"Hallsworth","given":"Alan G."}],"issued":{"raw":"January 01, 1996"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-07-04"}}]}

Veblen's theory take full account of the importance of prices rather than production as a factor that led to the British property and secondary banking crisis and to the resolution of that crisis. Accelerating property prices provided the rationale behind the property boom in 1970 and facilitated the overvaluation of property assets against which the banks provided finance to the property companies. The expansion of bank lending to the property sector, the initiation of the slump by the failure of a bank involved in the sector, the reaction of government and creditors to the crisis, and its long-term redistributive effects, are all encompassed in Veblen's analysis.","call-number":"9603276287","shortTitle":"The New Alchemy","author":[{"family":"Scott","given":"Peter"}],"issued":{"raw":"March 1996"}}]}

Horwitz's The Transformation of American Law, 1780-1860 is considered one of the most significant works ever published in American legal history. Since its publication in 1977, it has become the standard source on early nineteenth-century American law. In this monumental book, Morton J. Horwitz offers a sweeping overview of the emergence of our national (and modern) legal system from English and colonial antecedents. He begins with the common law, which emerged during the eighteenth century as the standard doctrine with which to solve disputes in an egalitarian manner. He shows that the turning point in the use of common law came after 1790, when the law was slowly transformed to favor economic growth and development, and the courts began to spur economic competition rather than circumscribe it. This new instrumental law would flourish during the nineteenth century as the legal profession and the mercantile elite forged a mutually beneficial alliance to gain wealth and power. Horwitz also demonstrates how the emergence of contract law corresponded to the development of economic and legal institutions of exchange. And he discusses how the rise of the market economy influenced legal practices, how contracts became ways to negate preexisting common law duties, and how (to the benefit of entrepreneurs and commercial groups) the courts were able to overthrow earlier anticommercial legal rules. Previous historical studies have viewed law and policy as an accurate reflection of the needs of an undifferentiated society. In The Transformation of American Law, Horwitz successfully challenges this misconception and shows how, in theeighty years after the American Revolution, a major change in law took place in which aspects of social struggle turned to legal channels for resolution. Looking into the distribution of wealth and power during this time, Horwitz finds indeed that the change in legal ideology enabled commercial groups to win a disproportionate amount of wealth and power in American society. An accessible account of the history of law, this is a powerful statement on the great role of the legal system in American economic development.","ISBN":"9780674903715","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Horwitz","given":"Morton J."}],"issued":{"raw":"1977"}}]}

[ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]","note":"Source: Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition, 11\/1\/2011 ; Agrarian reform ; Agrarian reform, redistribution of the agricultural resources of a country. Traditionally, agrarian, or land, reform is confined to the redistribution of land; in a broader sense it includes related changes in agricultural institutions, including credit, taxation, rents, and cooperatives. Although agrarian reform can result in lower agricultural productivity, especially if it includes collectivization, it may increase productivity when land is redistributed to the tiller.                      Pressure for modern land reform is most powerful in the underdeveloped nations. See also collective farm. ; History ; Agrarian reform has been a recurrent theme in history. The Greek and Roman eras were filled with violent struggles between landowners and the landless. The land reform issue was a major factor in the Gracchian agrarian laws. During the Middle Ages, demands for land reform triggered peasant rebellions, including the Peasants' Revolt in England led by John Ball and Wat Tyler in 1381 and the German Peasants' War of 1524-26. ; Russia ; In the 20th cent. the Russian Revolution added a new dimension to agrarian reform--the socialization of agriculture (i.e., the collective ownership of all land partly through state farming, but mainly through collective farming under state control) as a prerequisite for attaining communism. Driven in part by the peasant's desire for land, Lenin, shortly after assuming power, decreed (1917) all land as state property. Landed estates were seized by peasants, resulting in                      approximately 25 million peasant holdings. His government's promotion of voluntary collectivization was ineffective, however, and after 1929 Stalin forced collectivization at an estimated cost of ten million lives. After World War II, the Eastern European nations under Communist rule implemented agrarian reforms following the Soviet model. Since the collapse of Communist rule in Eastern Europe (1989-90) and the disintegration of the Soviet Union (1991) there has                      been movement, sometimes successful, sometimes fitful, toward privatization of agriculture in the former republics of the USSR.; China ; China's Communist revolution in 1949 led, after the wholesale transfer of land to small peasants, to the amalgation of peasant cooperatives into larger communes (1958). An attempt to establish socialist agriculture prior to mechanization, the communes were much criticized by the Soviet Union. They proved inefficient, causing stagnation in agricultural productivity, and China later abolished them. By 1980 China was rapidly returning land to individual smallholders and promoting                      market-oriented agriculture with marked success.; In Other Parts of the World ; In Asia, especially in such densely populated areas as the Indian subcontinent, agitation has been mainly for redistribution among landless laborers; for security of tenure; and for the elimination of middlemen, oppressive rents, and usurious interest. Agrarian reforms began in Japan during the Meiji Restoration (1868-1912), when feudal fiefs and stipends were abolished. After World War II, U.S. occupation forces supervised further land reform. As a result, by 1949 over 80% of                      Japan's tenanted land had been transferred from absentee landlords to tenant cultivators. In India and Pakistan similar programs of agrarian reform were attempted, with less success (see Bhave, Vinoba).; In S Africa, where racial policies resulted in discriminatory land policies in Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, majority rule in the late 20th cent. led to pressure for land redistribution. In Zimbabwe, wholesale land redistribution at the end of the 1900s resulted in near collapse of the country's commercial agriculture when land was transferred from white farmers to blacks who had little farming experience and inadequate equipment. Land reform has proceeded more gradually                      in Namibia and South Africa, resulting in greater frustration on the part of the landless but less significant decreases in agricultural production.; Latin America and Africa ; In South America land reform is a major problem because enormous tracts of land (latifundios) are concentrated in very few hands with laborers no better off than serfs. Although the revolution in Mexico resulted in land reform (1917), the program of redistribution of land is still only partially completed. A land reform law also followed the Bolivian revolution of 1952, but by 1970 only 45% of the peasant families had received titles to land. One of the most complete agrarian                      reforms in Latin America has taken place in Cuba, where land reform was one of the main platforms of the revolution of 1959. Large holdings were expropriated by the National Institute for Land Reform (INRA), but most is managed by government officials and has not been redistributed. The remaining agricultural land is limited to a ceiling with tenants gaining ownership rights. Nicaragua's agrarian reform under the Sandinistas resulted in expropriation of some large                      holdings (1979), which after initial collectivization has been progressively redistributed to individual farmers, including returning Contras after 1989. Chile's land reform (1970-73) was reversed when Socialist Salvador Allende was overthrown.; African agrarian reforms have included distribution of excess land (Algeria, 1971); nationalization of all land (Ethiopia, 1974); and abolition of all land titles to be replaced by rights of occupancy (Tanzania, Zambia and Nigeria). Tanzania promoted farming collectives (ujamaa) with limited success. ; Bibliography ; See D. Ghai and S. Radwan, ed., Agrarian Policies and Rural Poverty in Africa (1983); C. C. Geisler and F. J.

Because American society needs to find new means to finance transportation capital investment, particularly public transit, value capture offers an essentially painless opportunity to achieve these goals. It has the ancillary benefit also of concentrating population densities in a way that makes public transit particularly viable. This study shows how value capture could have been used to finance a portion of the New York State Interstate Highway System, a nine-mile stretch of I-87 known as the Northway, from its southern terminus to the point where it crosses the Mohawk River in Albany County. This section is the most heavily traveled area of the Northway and has experienced the greatest contiguous development of any location along the Northway's 178 miles since its construction in the late 1950s. While the right of way and construction costs of this stretch were in the range of $128 million (current dollars), the additional land value that has been generated on its account within just two miles on either side has totaled $3.734 billion. This study shows that the capital finance of the Northway, at least in this area, could easily have been done by recapturing these windfall gains that fell to private landowners. One could argue that this added value, the direct result of public investment, should rightfully be returned to the public and should be recaptured to pay off the bonds that were issued to build the project, rather than left for opportunistic speculators to reap private gain. Value capture therefore offers a promising approach for funding future transportation development, leaving fees, that are presently used, to recover operating and environmental costs.","URL":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu\/doi\/10.1111\/1536-7150.00061\/abstract","DOI":"10.1111\/1536-7150.00061","shortTitle":"Value Capture as a Policy Tool in Transportation Economics","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Batt","given":"H.

Evans promoted quantitative restrictions on land ownership, while George was known for his advocacy of a single tax on land. The New York Shakers, as large land owners, successfully resisted early G. H. Evans-type land reforms. Later, Shakers led by F. W. Evans embraced Henry George-type policy proposals and supported George for mayor of New York City. F. W. Evans himself, however, conflated Henry George's proposals with those of his brother, never realizing the contradiction between the two, much less resolving it.

This article shows that underlying this policy prescription is the assumption that institutions for pooling and spreading production risks are perfect. When account is taken of the imperfections in those institutions, some use of output taxes will be Pareto superior to a pure land tax regime and may induce higher output, as well. Henry George was wrong! These results generally apply even when the land tax is indexed to regional output, and when land is farmed under sharecropping. Even in these cases, a move from a pure land tax to a mix of land and low output taxes will reduce preexisting distortions in both consumption and production arising from the imperfection in risk markets.","URL":"http:\/\/wber.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/5\/1\/93","DOI":"10.1093\/wber\/5.1.93","journalAbbreviation":"World Bank Econ Rev","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Hoff","given":"Karla"}],"issued":{"raw":"01\/01\/1991"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-06-29"}}]}

In the spring of 1841, Thoreau started to build a hut with his own hands on the shores of Walden Pond. Thoreau claimed he had \"found that the student who wishes for a shelter can obtain one for a life time at an expense not greater than the rent which he now pays annually.\" Without any advance planning, Thoreau moved in triumphantly on July 4, 1845. He records in his book \"Walden\" the expense accounts for the first eight months. He earned by surveying, carpentry and day labor in the village, $13.34. He said he had as many trades as he had fingers. For the brief period of only a little more than two years, Thoreau lived at Walden Pond. He had only to get clothing and fuel. He could generally barter for food, avoiding trade. Here was a scholar who was in search of simple means of support. Hence, he made an experiment in independent living through subsistence farming. His explorations of the rich treasures of nature were considerably enhanced. He wrote a notable, book recording the experience, including expositions of his own philosophy of life.","call-number":"15408785","author":[{"family":"Landis","given":"Benson Y."}],"issued":{"raw":"April 1945"}}]}

The use of structured questionnaires provides data about the distribution and characteristics of social networks of squatters' closest friends (amigos de confianza) as well as other individuals who are approached for moral support and cash loans. Data are analysed according to socio-economic criteria to shed light upon social interaction behaviour among low-income groups. Socio-economic status rather than cultural attributes underpin interaction patterns and findings suggest that social networks of the very poor are more locally oriented. This is particularly marked for females who see each other on a daily or multiple-daily basis more often than their better-off counter-parts. All groups select kin for moral support and will overcome physical distance for this purpose. Interaction behaviour differs markedly between males and females while observed differences between settlement is largely a product of the different household structures that emerge with the integration of each community. The degree to which squatters are extra-local for the purpose of entertainment strongly reflects economic status.","URL":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/0016718578900015","DOI":"10.1016\/0016-7185(78)90001-5","author":[{"family":"Ward","given":"Peter M."}],"issued":{"raw":"1978"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-06-29"}}]}

The debate between \u2018state-assisted self-help\u2019 and \u2018official housing\u2019 policies is situated in the context of the conflicting interests of the different fractions of capital tied to the housing process.

{"items":[{"id":"559764\/U3NSVGVZ","type":"webpage","title":"Agrarian reform in Venezuela : defensible from a socio-economic perspective?","abstract":"The land reform in Venezuela was introduced in 2001 and will according to its proponents decrease the countrys oil dependency through increasing agricultural production. The law also intends to decrease inequalities in the society by giving land to landless peasants. To achieve this, a land tax will be introduced on unproductive land and land can also be expropriated or repossessed by the state. The land reform has been criticised a lot and its opponents believe the reform will result in a major flight of capital as well as decreasing investments because of insecurity and consequently less agricultural production. The aim of this paper is to find out whether this land reform could be defensible from a socio-economic perspective. To achieve the aim the starting point has been economic theories of how an agrarian reform could be conducted in an economically defensible way and focus has been on efficiency, investments and inequality. Further an interview study in Venezuela in the autumn of 2005 has been carried through. Does the Venezuelan land reform comply with the theoretical design? There are different opinions about this. Generally could be claimed that it does not comply with the traditional theories about efficiency, however, if the models are somewhat modified and under certain assumptions the reform might be defensible from an efficiency point of view. When it comes to investments it is uncertain whether they will increase because of secured property rights for the peasants or decrease because of the insecurity that large landowners experience. The final outcome will depend on how the law will be interpreted as well as to what extent the peasants will receive support. The reform will probably reduce inequalities in Venezuela, which could be favourable for the economy but this could also increase insecurity for investors. Further some practical problems might prevent a positive development.","URL":"http:\/\/ex-epsilon.slu.se:8080\/archive\/00001459\/","shortTitle":"Agrarian reform in Venezuela","language":"English","author":[{"family":"St\u00e5lberg","given":"Annie"}],"issued":{"raw":"2006"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-06-27"}}]}

More important, the analysis of famine is inseparable from the problems of agricultural technology, inequality, and dependence in normal times.

This article argues that their function was about more than mere adornment. Through their presence, lineages of political longevity were established and memories of the radical past invoked. This article considers the totemic role of the &lsquo;old Chartists&rsquo;. It locates their significance for successor movements, and scrutinizes their importance in augmenting and modifying the historiography of Chartism. It argues that the personal stories of veteran Chartists were formative for later depictions of the movement, and remain integral to the creation of a radical historiography mediated through the lived experience of struggle, and the historical memory of reform. By engaging with recent &lsquo;continuity&rsquo; debates in the historiography of nineteenth-century popular politics, this article argues that the role of the veteran Chartist contributed to a radical inter-generational history of reform that frequently remained independent of both liberalism and Toryism.","shortTitle":"\u2018The Old Chartist\u2019","language":"English","author":[{"family":"TAYLOR","given":"ANTONY"}],"issued":{"raw":"2010"}}]}

The report is largely based on an interpretation of preexisting literature and data but also encompasses the findings from a few previously unreported case studies carried out over the period 1973-75. The report provides a brief overview of the extent to which land reform measures have been implemented--the acreages and the number of beneficiaries involved--in each country. More importantly, the report distinguishes between land reforms which have occurred at different stages of agricultural development and under different pre-existing land tenure structures and types of post-reform organization. With typologies of this kind, it has been possible to make some preliminary judgments about the effects various land reform and associated policies might have for general agricultural development and income distribution in alternative environments.","number":"No. 275","author":[{"family":"Eckstein, S.","given":""},{"family":"Donald, G","given":""},{"family":"Horton, D.","given":""}],"issued":{"raw":"April 1978"}}]}

This paper describes the work done as part of the Google Summer of Code 2008 using a combination of regular-expression based heuristics and knowledge-based systems to develop a system which matches inline citations to their corresponding bibliographic references and identifies and extracts metadata from references. The description, implementation and results of our approach have been presented here.

Although giving support to the flat, it was also intended to re\u2010introduce the house as a major element in the redevelopment of all but the west\u2010central parts of London. After the war, however, with a few notable exceptions, the London Plan version of mixed development failed to become established in practice. This was due partly to the re\u2010opening of divisions which the Plans had sought to close. But it was also due to the manner in which the debate linked to mainstream political and financial concerns, and this is the aspect on which the article concentrates. In particular, it examines the development of the subsidy structure and its links with planning concerns and local politics. The discussion relates to the significance of the land values issue to war\u2010time planning, the failure to achieve a full solution, the \u2018return to reality\u2019 during and after the war, and the continuities between pre\u2010war and post\u2010war periods.","URL":"http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/02665439408725793","DOI":"10.1080\/02665439408725793","author":[{"family":"Yelling","given":"J.A."}],"issued":{"raw":"1994"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-06-08"}}]}

At the same time, some contemporaries regarded such destruction as an opportunity not only for the reconstruction of the built environment but also for the creation of a fairer society. The replanning of the blitzed areas became a symbol of the aspiration to build a New Jerusalem.\nThis article examines the fate of radical town planning ideas in the 1940s and the early 1950s with particular reference to the rebuilding of heavily bombed cities. It analyses the visions which inspired reconstruction plans, examines their conception and studies the visionaries, both ordinary citizens and the political elite.\nThe process of postwar reconstruction in general has become a much-debated subject in political, economic and social history in recent years, but there has been a serious lack of detailed examination of postwar urban replanning and redevelopment. This article, therefore, also considers how the rebuilding of war-damaged cities should be evaluated in the light of the contemporary political, economic, and social realities and issues during the period of postwar reconstruction.","URL":"http:\/\/tcbh.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/10\/2\/137","DOI":"10.1093\/tcbh\/10.2.137","journalAbbreviation":"Twentieth Century Brit Hist","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Hasegawa","given":"Junichi"}],"issued":{"raw":"01\/01\/1999"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-06-08"}}]}

I also argue that town planning is an integral part of the land and property market which itself is conditioned by the definition of the rights in land and property. These rights are shown to be grounded in the traditions of the private land law as evolved over centuries from the feudal system of land and property relations. I therefore begin with an examination of development under the leasehold system in London during the 18th and 19th centuries and find that landowners, in their efforts of maintaining the value of their estate, conducted a form of environmental control very similar to what planners do nowadays as part of their activities in development control. It is then shown how the old system was unable to cope with the pressures of industrialisation and rapidly expanding urban areas. Politicians, royal commissions, and expert committees sought to adapt the leasehold system and to reform existing property rights to accommodate a newly emerging property market. These efforts finally culminated in the 1925 Property Statutes. At the same time governments pursued efforts of devising new structures of urban governance. However, these measures generally were piecemeal and their implementation was fraught with difficulties. A new approach, recognising the interdependence between market processes, market regulation, and 'public improvement', were championed by the radical Liberals towards the end of the 19th century. This philosophy is reflected in the enactment of the first planning statutes of 1909 and 1919. Both Acts made provisions for the retainment of development value for reasons of social justice and the funding of urban infrastructure. Subsequent enactments have tended to isolate town planning not only from housing but also from the land market and the issue of betterment, and thus from urban governance. The reason, it is argued, is that property as well as planning legislation are still hemmed in the straitjacket of the private land law. I conclude that the isolation of town planning within a fragmented 'public domain' bodes ill for the future of our cities.","URL":"http:\/\/www.envplan.com\/abstract.cgi?id=a291399","DOI":"10.1068\/a291399","author":[{"family":"Luithlen","given":"L."}],"issued":{"raw":"1997"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-06-08"}}]}

As far as rural land is concerned, the problems associated with ownership rights are those that relate either to non-market effects or to the \u2018unearned increment\u2019 or to landlord\/tenant relationships.

Emilio Gentile has provided detailed criteria to distinguish \u2018political religion\u2019 from \u2018civil religion\u2019 and \u2018politicised religion\u2019 from \u2018religion as politics\u2019. This paper tries to apply this taxonomy to late Victorian and Edwardian socialism in Britain. Intellectual arguments for a \u2018religion of socialism\u2019\u2013 as well as less-theorised religious behaviour \u2013 are evident within three groupings that shaped the British socialist revival: the Social Democratic Federation, The Fabian Society, and the Independent Labour Party. Surveying members of each, including Ernest Belfort Bax, the Webbs, Shaw, Wells; John Trevor, and Keir Hardie, the paper lastly turns to Edward Carpenter, who moved between the aforementioned groups during his career, and whose popular and influential writings vividly capture socialism\u2019s spiritual character. His case also illustrates the major obstacle in applying Gentile\u2019s taxonomy to this period, namely the pervasive monism of the age, which blurs concepts of the temporal and divine. In conclusion, we can see that Edwardian socialism provided good conditions for the emergence of political religion but also for the civil religion of today\u2019s centre left. A much more detailed discussion, beyond our scope here, might consider Gentile\u2019s distinctions between functionalist, manipulative, noumenal forms of religiosity; distinctions brought home to Edwardian intellectuals through new theories of charisma and crowd psychology. Their knowledge, and application, of these ideas more clearly anticipates the rise of fascism; although, in the same generation, we should note a return to dualism as a defence against totalitarian political religion.","URL":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1749-8171.2010.00244.x\/abstract","DOI":"10.1111\/j.1749-8171.2010.00244.x","shortTitle":"Edwardian Intellectuals and Political Religions","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Mead","given":"Henry"}],"issued":{"raw":"2010"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-06-07"}}]}

Both the Daily Herald and Weekly Illustrated (later simply Illustrated) were established as socialist publications, owned by and overtly in support of the Labour party of the day. The photographic archive for these publications is held at the National Media Museum, Bradford (UK), and includes a section on Agriculture. Drawing on material from the archive, this paper examines photographic representations of the countryside and rural issues in these publications and interrogates their political and ideological underpinnings.

Both the Daily Herald and Weekly Illustrated (later simply Illustrated) were established as socialist publications, owned by and overtly in support of the Labour party of the day.

Drawing on material from the archive, this paper examines photographic representations of the countryside and rural issues in these publications and interrogates their political and ideological underpinnings.

The White Paper, Agricultural Policy, of 1926 claimed its provisions, when taken together, offered the support and confidence farmers required to help themselves, whilst avoiding any controversial initiatives. The synthesis of 'expert' opinion, parliamentary lobbying and ministerial discussion, encapsulated in the White Paper, affords an example of the difficulties government met in reconciling expectations of a more proactive approach to policy making with the variety of insight and enterprise called for in 'modernizing' an industry so diverse in its circumstances as agriculture.","shortTitle":"The White Paper, Agricultural Policy, of 1926","author":[{"family":"Sheail","given":"John"}],"issued":{"raw":"2010"}}]}

This brought the need for greater bureaucratic machinery which would connect individual farmers and their communities with central government. Crucial from 1939 in this respect was the formation of the County War Agricultural Executive Committees, which became the channels through which English farming was propelled into postwar productivism. Using relatively newly-available documentary material, this article demonstrates the role the committees played in the transmission of national policies down to the local level, their composition and membership. In so doing it also places the economic changes within farming into the vital but under-researched context of their rural social relations during the Second World War.","DOI":"10.1017\/S0956793307002166","shortTitle":"War in the Fields and Villages","author":[{"family":"Short","given":"Brian"}],"issued":{"raw":"2007"}}]}

In the 1950s Labour promised to \u2018municipalize\u2019 all rent-controlled dwellings, some six million houses and flats. After municipalization proved electorally unattractive in 1959 Labour turned to the idea of a Land Commission to purchase all commercially developable land at 30 per cent more than its \u2018use value\u2019. That land would then be leased to developers, thus realizing most of the \u2018unearned increment\u2019 for the state. Labour's promise to use the Land Commission to control land speculation and end rising prices in land contributed to Harold Wilson's victory in 1964, although in the event the Land Commission failed to realize its promise. In addition to adding a neglected dimension to the history of the Labour Party in these decades, this article argues that the issue of land reform shows the continued radicalism of the Labour Party, the continued strength of the ethical tradition in its socialism, and the continued hold on its members of a vision for social transformation.","URL":"http:\/\/tcbh.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/19\/3\/314","DOI":"10.1093\/tcbh\/hwn016","shortTitle":"Labour and the Land","journalAbbreviation":"Twentieth Century Brit Hist","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Weiler","given":"Peter"}],"issued":{"raw":"01\/01\/2008"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-06-07"}}]}

The wartime controversy over land reform reached a climax during the second half of 1944 following the publication of the Government's Town and Country Planning Bill and the White Paper on Control of Land\u2010Use. Up until 1945 the Labour Party supported a policy of land nationalization, but this was not included in the manifesto for the 1945 General Election. This article will argue that the Labour Party abandoned a policy of land nationalization not because it feared the creation of internal divisions or damaging its electoral chances (support for land nationalization was anyway running high in the opinion polls), but that it was responding to pressure from Labour local government for more immediate housing and town planning reform.","URL":"http:\/\/tcbh.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/14\/2\/165","DOI":"10.1093\/tcbh\/14.2.165","shortTitle":"The Conflict over Property Rights during the Second World War","journalAbbreviation":"Twentieth Century Brit Hist","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Tichelar","given":"Michael"}],"issued":{"raw":"01\/01\/2003"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-06-07"}}]}

From accounting for only five percent of the value of Chile's total exports in the late 1960s, agricultural exports grew to account for more than 30 percent of this value in the mid 1990s. Using a modified neoclassical growth formulation, we show that the transformation of the Chilean agricultural sector can be associated with institutional changes or modifications to the sector's basic functioning structure. In particular, our historical review shows that changes in the definition of property rights over land, caused by the Chilean agrarian reform first and the general economic reform later, seem to have greatly caused the changes in the sector's levels of investment and production.","URL":"http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/10419\/45656","shortTitle":"The Chilean agricultural transformation during the second half of the twentieth century","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Saravia","given":"Antonio"}],"issued":{"raw":"uuuu"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-06-06"}}]}

These two very different struggles are representative of two important periods in radical politics \u2013 the class politics, tempered by Popular Frontism, that operated in the 1930s, and the new social movement politics of the seventies. In the rent strikes of the 1930s the ultimate goal was Communism. Although the local Party was disproportionately Jewish, Communist theory required an outward looking orientation that embraced the whole of the working class. In the squatting movement of the 1970s political organisers attempted to steer the Bengalis onto the path of black radicalism, championing separate organisation and turning the community inwards. An examination of the implementation and consequences of these different movements can help us to understand the possibilities and problems for the transformation of grass-roots activism into a broader political force, and the processes of political mobilisation of ethnic minority groups.","URL":"http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0305748804000659","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jhg.2004.07.019","shortTitle":"East End immigrants and the battle for housing","author":[{"family":"Glynn","given":"S."}],"issued":{"raw":"July 2005"},"accessed":{"raw":"2012-06-05"}}]}

The Drama of Capital: Risk, Belief, and Liability on the Victorian Stage","abstract":"This chapter examines Victorian drama and its dealings with risk and liability. Here, The Poor of New York is presented as a striking example of a wider issue: the dramatization of scenes from advanced capitalism, particularly the transformation of financial danger into theatrical display, which occurred diversely on the Victorian stage. Analysing interwoven financial relationships, the chapter establishes the common elements of trust, illusion, and deceit that bound capital and drama together and which were knowingly exploited to produce what is called the capitalist aesthetics of Victorian sensation culture. The cultural form of 19th-century drama is uncannily like capital itself because it is built on appearances, characterised by insoluble contradiction, and defined by extreme forms of distortion: in the age of high capitalism, drama accordingly acquired a peculiar diagnostic power.","shortTitle":"5.
